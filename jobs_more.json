On June 16, 2004, Tencent Holdings\r\n Limited (SEHK 700) went public on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. \r\nIt is Tencent's mission to enhance the quality of human life through Internet services. Presently, Tencent provides social platforms and digital content services under the \u201cConnection\u201d Strategy.

The institute focuses on the self-development of core Internet technologies, in pursuing its development and innovation for the industry. \r\nTencent's long term vision is to become the most respected Internet enterprise. In order to fulfill corporate social responsibilities and to promote civil Internet communities, Tencent has been actively participating in public charity programs. In 2006, Tencent\r\n inaugurated the Tencent Charity Fund, the first charity foundation set up by a Chinese Internet enterprise, and the public charity website gongyi.qq.com. The website focuses on youth education, assisting impoverished communities, care for the disadvantaged,\r\n and disaster relief.
